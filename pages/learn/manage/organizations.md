# Organization management

An **organization** in balenaCloud is a group of users (members), teams, and applications,
with an access control system. Organization _members_ are balenaCloud users who may be grouped into _teams_, and can be assigned _roles_ such as developer, observer, or operator in balenaCloud applications. Organizations essentially improve visibility and reasoning over who has access to which applications and, consequently, to which device fleets.

The feature is available for use in all balenaCloud accounts irrespective of plans. A balenaCloud account may contain one or more organizations.

## What can you do with organizations?

With organizations, you can:

* Invite users to an organization as members, and group them in teams.
* Manage access control at the team level, associating applications with teams.
* Granular access control at the application level with ability to assign, modify or revoke user roles when needed.
* Provide application access to teams or individual members in bulk.

## Creating a new organization

To create a new organization, navigate to your balenaCloud dashboard and click the `Organizations` tab on the sidebar.

Next, click the `Create Organization` button to get the create organization modal below. Fill in the name of your organization, and you are all set. This is also the page where you can check all organizations that you have access to. The user creating an organization is, by default, given administrator access to that organization.

Only administrators can delete an organization. Alternatively, anyone can leave an organization by clicking the `Leave organization` button on the organization summary page.

## Managing roles & access in an organization

The roles inside the organization give granular control over access & visibility to the user. These roles can be assigned when inviting new members to your organization:

* **Administrator**: Full access to the organization, its applications, and all devices inside them. Administrators can set roles for incoming members, group them into teams, and provide application access to those teams with granular control over which roles are being assigned at the application level.

* **Member**: Members are provided with read-only access to an organization with explicit access to its applications and teams. Administrators assign roles on the application level. Members have no visibility over other applications and teams that they haven't been assigned access to.

### Inviting members to an organization

With your organization created, let's invite some members. Only the administrator can invite users to an organization. To invite, click the `Manage members` button on the organization summary dashboard. On the page that opens, click the `Invite member` button to open the `Invite organization member` modal. Here, you can either add users with their email address or with their balena username after assigning them roles in your organization. Click `Add member` to invite the user to your organization.

Depending on the role assigned, they will be able to access, see, and manage both apps and other members inside the organization. To change a member's role, navigate to the `Organization Members` tab in the sidebar. Next, change the `Organization role` of the desired user using the dropdown list against their username.

## Creating teams in your organization

With organizations, you can group your existing members to form teams as well. Teams are a robust way to manage members by their function, and bulk provides access to applications as needed. Only administrators are allowed to create a team. To form a team, navigate to the `Organization Teams` tab in the sidebar. On the page that opens, click the `Create Team` button and enter the team's name that is being created.

When the team is created, you can start adding members and applications to that specific team through the `Manage members` and `Manage applications` buttons, respectively.

## Creating new applications under your organization

With members invited to the organization, let's get started on creating new applications under an organization. Navigate to the `Organization Applications` tab in the sidebar to find the `Create application` button for creating a new application under your organization. Learn more about creating an application from the [getting started](getting-started) guide.

### Moving existing applications to an organization

Moving an existing application to an organization is a common task accomplished by [transferring ownership](transferring-ownership) of your application.

### Providing access to multiple applications

With organizations, providing access to individual members or teams becomes a hassle-free process. There are mainly three application-level roles that can be assigned, [`Developer`](developer), [`Observer`](observer), and [`Operator`](operator). Administrators have the [Owner](owner) role by default for all applications under an organization and are the only ones that can provide access to applications.

- **Providing access to members** - Once you are done inviting members, click the username of the member you want to provide access to from the `Members` list. When the member's summary page opens, click `Manage applications` to see all applications available under the org. From there, click the `Add to applications` button to add the member to one or more applications available under the org with the desired role.

- **Providing access to teams** - Once you are done forming a team, navigate to the team, you want to provide access to in the `Organization Teams` tab.  Next, click the `Manage applications` button on the team page to see all applications available under the org. From there, click the `Add applications to team` button to add the team to one or more applications available under the org with the desired roles. All members of that team will be provided access to the selected application(s) with the specified role per application.

## Users as an organization - hassle-free app sharing

With organizations being a crucial feature for collaboration, we wanted the same for each individual user too. Hence, every user in balenaCloud owns an organization by default named after their username. In this **default organization**, all applications and devices are private until **explicitly shared** by the user.

Default organizations can be used to develop & test applications. When ready, these applications can be shared with other members or teams by inviting users to your organization. A default organization is no different from any other organization that you can create. This way, each user is empowered to collaborate, manage, and work on their fleets securely.

### I've got an app. How do I collaborate with others?

To collaborate with other users on a single app, you can refer to adding an [application member](add-application-member) using their email address or username. After adding the user, you will find them in your organization added as a member as well. Member will only have access to those application(s) you explicitly provide them access to. You can review each member's access by clicking the member's username in the `Members` list present on the organization summary page. On the page with your view as an administrator, you can check what teams and applications the member has access to.
